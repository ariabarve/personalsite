        <div class="content">
            Another short post since it’s midnight and I’m quite tired. I started my day with another cup of coffee and watched a video from the Wall Street Journal CFO Network. Listened to insights from Lynn Martin (President of NYSE) on the state of the stock market (super interesting listen). <br><br>

            Headed over to Spanish (my only class of the day) before studying for my econ final for a couple hours. Before I knew it, it was time for dinner and after eating with a friend I went to the Yale Daily News building. Completed some tasks for YDN and then came back to my room to study for more finals. <br><br>

            Finally ended the day by reading a WSJ article on how some companies are seeing great returns from using AI agents to automate workflows. Super interesting to read about how these agents are expediting mundane tasks and in the case of BNY, a financial services company, comprising entire teams that report to human managers.

            Today will be a shorter post since I spent most of the day studying for finals. I started my day with a cup of coffee while listening to an episode of The Burnouts Podcast ft. Haley Sacks (AKA Mrs. Dow Jones). The episode discussed personal finance and investing in today’s economic climate. <br><br>

            I then went to my CS, Linear Algebra and Microeconomics classes before heading over to Sterling to get some work done on my stats project and book a flight back home for Christmas break. I then helped my friend run a couple errands before we grabbed dinner and I headed back to my room. <br><br>
            
            I studied for my econ final for a couple hours and then read a couple articles from the Wall Street Journal. Learned about <a href = "https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/nvidias-fat-margins-are-google-and-amds-opportunity-69591c66">Nvidia’s profit margins</a> and <a href = "https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-estee-lauder-and-google-taught-ai-to-sell-fragrances-73a8876c?mod=ai_more_article_pos3">how Google trained their Gemini model specifically for Estée Lauder</a>. I highly highly recommend taking just 15-20 minutes out of your day to either read a WSJ article or listen to their podcasts. You learn so much with even just a small time investment. <br><br>
            
            To wrap up quickly, today’s lesson would be to read everyday with the goal of learning something new in a field you’re interested in. I wish I had started this years ago, but now is always a good time to start! :)

      <div class="title">Day 1!</div>
      <div class="content">
        Today I started this blog, which, admittedly, was a New Year’s resolution but I didn’t feel like waiting a whole month. I’m writing (quite informally and probably from my bed) to document something new I learn every day and something I achieve (no matter how small!)<br><br>

I finally got around to listening to The Burnouts, a podcast by Phoebe Gates and Sophia Kianni (co founders of fashion tech startup Phia). Completely loved listening to them talk about how they started their company and the successes/failures they’ve been through during their ongoing entrepreneurial journey. <br><br>

After studying for some finals in Bass, I grabbed dinner with a friend and then went to my room to study a bit more and work on a couple projects. I ended the day by reading a couple articles from the Wall Street Journal (interesting insights on Amazon releasing AI agents and OpenAI developing better models) and writing up this blog post.<br><br>

Although I’ve been at Yale for a couple months now, I haven’t yet fully explored and engaged with all of what this school has to offer. Sophia and Phoebe touch on this in their podcast but they mention how during their time at Stanford they had a classmate who would constantly meet with high profile people like Mark Zuckerberg and Sam Altman. When they asked him how he managed to meet with those people, he said he sent hundreds of emails a day. Sometimes multiple to the same people (who would eventually after many emails respond). Throughout their journey with Phia, Sophia and Phoebe have experienced the same process of putting themselves out there and getting accustomed to rejection. <br><br>

If I could give one piece of advice to anyone who may have stumbled across this blog, it would be to get more comfortable with being uncomfortable. Start that blog, cold email that person, apply for that job and realize that you are always one action away from where you want to be.
