        Today I started this blog, which, admittedly, was a New Year’s resolution but I didn’t feel like waiting a whole month. I’m writing (quite informally and probably from my bed) to document something new I learn every day and something I achieve (no matter how small!)<br><br>

I finally got around to listening to The Burnouts, a podcast by Phoebe Gates and Sophia Kianni (co founders of fashion tech startup Phia). Completely loved listening to them talk about how they started their company and the successes/failures they’ve been through during their ongoing entrepreneurial journey. <br><br>

After studying for some finals in Bass, I grabbed dinner with a friend and then went to my room to study a bit more and work on a couple projects. I ended the day by reading a couple articles from the Wall Street Journal (interesting insights on Amazon releasing AI agents and OpenAI developing better models) and writing up this blog post.<br><br>

Although I’ve been at Yale for a couple months now, I haven’t yet fully explored and engaged with all of what this school has to offer. Sophia and Phoebe touch on this in their podcast but they mention how during their time at Stanford they had a classmate who would constantly meet with high profile people like Mark Zuckerberg and Sam Altman. When they asked him how he managed to meet with those people, he said he sent hundreds of emails a day. Sometimes multiple to the same people (who would eventually after many emails respond). Throughout their journey with Phia, Sophia and Phoebe have experienced the same process of putting themselves out there and getting accustomed to rejection. <br><br>

If I could give one piece of advice to anyone who may have stumbled across this blog, it would be to get more comfortable with being uncomfortable. Start that blog, cold email that person, apply for that job and realize that you are always one action away from where you want to be.
